# Counter-Strike 2 Map Images
Here are map screenshots that you can use for your CS2-related projects. The goal is to serve as a public, high-quality ***(but usable)*** repository that anyone can use for their projects.

## Want to add maps?
1. Strictly images taken from inside CS2 only.
2. Your image must be in **16:9** ratio and **1920x1080px**.
3. No HUD included - make the image as clean as possible. **(`cl_drawhud 0` or `cl_draw_only_deathnotices 1`)**
4. Remove CS2 build information. **(`r_show_build_info 0`)**
5. Images must be in **`.png`** format.
6. Keep files under **~1MB** in file size. ***(Compress the images before uploading with https://tinypng.com/ to reach this size)***
7. The image name must be the exact map filename, for example **`de_mirage.png`**.
8. All images must be placed in the CS2 folder. This way people can link to it and simply change the map name in their URL for their project.
9. No logos or URLs in the images.

You can add maps to this repository by creating an issue with the image attached.
**You must also include `Map: mapname` in the issue description! This must be exactly the same as the in-game map name!**

## FAQ
**- Q. Why only 1920x1080?**

**A.** Images like this are only really ever used in thumbnails or in designs where the image itself is not the focus.

**- Q. Why 1MB?**

**A.** This is to keep the collection at a manageable file size once there are thousands of images.
