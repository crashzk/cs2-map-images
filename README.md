# Counter-Strike 2 Map Images
Here are map screenshots that you can use for your CS2-related projects. The goal is to serve as a public, high-quality ***(but usable)*** repository that anyone can use for their projects.

You can add maps to this repository by creating an issue with the image attached.
**You must also include `Map: mapname` in the issue description!**

## Rules:
1. Your image must be in **16:9** ratio and **1920x1080px**.
2. No HUD included - make the image as clean as possible. **(`cl_drawhud 0` or `cl_draw_only_deathnotices 1`)**
3. Remove CS2 build information. **(`r_show_build_info 0`)**
4. Images must be in **`.png`** format.
5. Keep files under **~1MB** in file size. ***(Compress the images before uploading with `https://tinypng.com/` to reach this size)***
6. No logos or URLs in the images.

## FAQ
**- Q. Why only 1920x1080?**

**A.** Images like this are only really ever used in thumbnails or in designs where the image itself is not the focus.

**- Q. Why 1MB?**

**A.** This is to keep the collection at a manageable file size once there are thousands of images.
